   - Data restoration feature

7. **Responsive GUI**
   - Swing-based user interface with custom styling
   - Adaptive layout for different screen sizes
   - Keyboard shortcuts for efficient operation

## Technical Stack

- **Language**: Java 11
- **GUI Framework**: Swing
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0 / PostgreSQL 13
- **ORM**: Custom JDBC implementation
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Testing**: JUnit 5, Mockito
- **Logging**: SLF4J with Logback
- **Additional Libraries**: 
  - Apache Commons (IO, Lang3)
  - JFreeChart for data visualization
  - iText for PDF generation

## Architecture and Design Patterns

The application follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Presentation Layer** (GUI)
   - Implements MVC pattern within Swing components
   - Uses Observer pattern for real-time updates

2. **Business Logic Layer**
   - Incorporates Strategy pattern for payment processing
   - Utilizes Command pattern for undo/redo functionality

3. **Data Access Layer**
   - Implements Repository pattern for data operations
   - Uses Data Access Object (DAO) pattern for database interactions

4. **Cross-Cutting Concerns**
   - Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) for logging and transaction management

## Database Schema

The application uses a relational database with the following key tables:

- Users
- Products
- Categories
- Sales
- SaleItems
- Payments
- Inventory

## Key Implementation Highlights

1. **Custom Connection Pool**
   - Efficient database connection management
   - Configurable pool size and connection timeout

2. **Transaction Management**
   - Custom implementation ensuring ACID properties
   - Proper handling of nested transactions

3. **Caching Mechanism**
   - In-memory caching of frequently accessed data
   - Cache invalidation strategy to ensure data consistency

4. **Multithreading**
   - Use of ExecutorService for background tasks
   - Implementation of producer-consumer pattern for order processing

5. **Security Measures**
   - Input validation and sanitization to prevent SQL injection
   - XSS protection in generated reports
   - Proper exception handling and logging to prevent information leakage

6. **Internationalization (i18n)**
   - Support for multiple languages
   - Locale-specific formatting of dates and currencies

7. **Performance Optimization**
   - Lazy loading of data in UI components
   - Pagination for large datasets
   - Indexing strategy for database queries

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Cover all service and utility classes (80%+ code coverage)
- **Integration Tests**: Focus on DAO classes and database interactions
- **UI Tests**: Automated testing of critical user flows using AssertJ Swing
- **Performance Tests**: JMeter scripts for load testing critical operations

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Challenge**: Ensuring data consistency in a multi-user environment
   **Solution**: Implemented optimistic locking mechanism and proper transaction isolation levels

2. **Challenge**: Responsive UI while performing long-running operations
   **Solution**: Utilized SwingWorker for background processing and implemented a custom event dispatch system

3. **Challenge**: Complex report generation impacting system performance
   **Solution**: Implemented a caching mechanism for report data and asynchronous report generation

4. **Challenge**: Scalability issues with increasing data volume
   **Solution**: Implemented database partitioning and optimized query performance through proper indexing and query optimization

## Future Enhancements

1. Migration to a microservices architecture for better scalability
2. Implementation of a REST API for potential mobile app integration
3. Integration with cloud services (AWS/Azure) for improved reliability and scalability
4. Machine learning integration for predictive analytics and inventory optimization
